# Speech Recognition with Python: Fourier Transform, Spectrograms, and MFCCs

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing audio signals and extracting features for speech recognition and other machine learning tasks. The code demonstrates recording audio, visualizing waveforms, generating spectrograms, and extracting **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**.

## Features
- Record and save audio as a WAV file.
- Visualize time-domain waveforms using Matplotlib.
- Generate spectrograms to analyze frequency variations over time.
- Extract MFCCs, a compact representation of audio signals, for machine learning.
